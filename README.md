This project is bootstraped using Vite React + Typescript template.
Tailwind CSS is used for styling the react components.

The application state is stored in local storage and can be loaded during initial render if available already.

NOTE: Arbitary values style instead of default tailwind classes are used in certain cases to match the input requirements.
